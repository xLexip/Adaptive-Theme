# Adaptive Theme: Auto Dark Mode by Ambient Light

Adaptive Theme automatically switches between light and **dark mode**
using the **ambient light sensor** — not a fixed schedule.

It adapts to real lighting conditions to optimize **readability**, **eye comfort**, and **battery
life**.

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 minutes)

1. **Install** Adaptive Theme.
2. **Grant the permission** with the [web-tool](https://lexip.dev/setup), Shizuku, or other methods
   below.
3. **Pick your lux threshold** and you’re done. ✅

## ✨ Features & Highlights

* 🌤️ **Smart Detection:** Uses your devices physical light sensor to switch the system
  theme.
* ⚙️ **Custom brightness threshold:** Choose exactly when the theme should flip or use a preset (
  indoor, outdoor, sunlight, etc.).
* 🔋 **Battery Friendly:** The app is passive. Its event-driven architecture only checks the sensor
  when you turn on the screen — zero battery drain in the background.
* 🗝️ **No Root Required:** Root access is not required (but supported as an alternative setup
  method).
* 🐱 **Shizuku Support:** One of multiple setup options is
  using [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku).
* 🚀 **Modern & Native:** Built with best-practices using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Material You
  for a smooth and solid experience.
* 🌍 **50+ Languages:** Applied globalization at its best.
* 🔒 **Transparent:** Free, open-source, no-ads.

## 🛠️ One-Time Setup

Android restricts apps from changing system themes by default. To unlock this feature, the
permission (`WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`) has to be granted.

The app comes with an easy step-by-step setup process, that lets you choose one of the following
methods to do so:

* **Web Tool (Recommended)** – A browser-based setup tool on a secondary device (Computer,
  Tablet,
  or Phone). No code or ADB
  installation required (WebADB).
  👉 **[lexip.dev/setup](https://lexip.dev/setup)**

* **Shizuku** – If you have **[Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku)** installed and
  configured, you can
  grant the permission directly within Adaptive Theme.

* **Root** – If your device is rooted, you can grant the permission directly in Adaptive Theme as
  well.

* **Manual ADB** – If you have ADB installed on your computer, you can simply run the ADB command
  manually:
  ```adb shell pm grant dev.lexip.hecate android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS```

## ✅ Safety

The required permission only allows the app to change system settings such as the dark mode. This is
absolutely safe and
completely reversible by uninstalling the app. It does **not** grant root access or read any user
data.

## ⚙️ How it Works

**Wondering why the theme didn't change immediately?**

To avoid screen flicker and unnecessary background work, Adaptive Theme follows strict rules:

- **Event-driven:** It checks the light sensor only right after the screen turns on. Combined with
  hysteresis, this prevents flicker, avoids interruptions while you’re using the phone, and saves
  battery.
- **Validity check:** It verifies that the sensor is not obstructed (e.g., by a hand or pocket).
- **Seamless switch:** It switches the theme instantly, ensuring the UI is ready before you start
  interacting with it.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does this require root?**

* No. It works on stock devices. However, if you have Root, it can be used as an alternative setup
  method.

**Does it work with custom Android skins (Xiaomi MIUI, Samsung OneUI, etc.)?**

* In most cases, yes. It works with any system that respects the native Android Dark Mode
  implementation.

**My theme doesn’t change — what should I check?**

- Keep in mind that the theme only switched immediately after the screen is turned on, to optimize
  sensor usage and to not interrupt
  your device usage.
- Check that your sensor isn’t covered when you turn the screen on.
- Adjust your lux threshold and test in clearly bright/dim conditions.
- Check if the current lux value is shown correctly in the Adaptive Theme app.

Adaptive Theme is built with modern Android engineering standards to ensure a lightweight,
maintainable, and production-ready codebase.

**Modern Codebase:** Written entirely in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 (Material You),
including haptic feedback.

**Architecture:** Follows the MVVM pattern with a Single-Activity architecture.

**Reactive Data:** ViewModels expose data via Kotlin Flows and manage concurrency with Coroutines.

**Persistence:** Type-safe settings storage with Jetpack DataStore.

**Background Work:** Sensor operations run event-driven – only upon screen-on
broadcasts – ensuring zero unnecessary battery drain in the background.
