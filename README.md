## Adaptive Theme

Adaptive Theme intelligently switches your device between Light and Dark mode based on your
environment.

Get the readability of Light mode in bright daylight and the comfort of Dark mode in low light —
going easy on your eyes and your battery.

### Highlights

🌤️ **Smart Detection**: Uses your ambient light sensor to switch themes automatically.

⚙️ **Full Control**: Fully customizable brightness threshold and a Quick Settings tile to
pause/resume the service.

🔒 **Free & Open**: Free to use, no ads and open source.

🚀 **Native Design**: Modern architecture, built with Jetpack Compose and Material You for a seamless
Android experience.

🚫 **No Flickering**: The theme only changes when you turn on screen and the device is uncovered.

---

### One-Time Setup

To toggle the system theme, Android requires the permission  `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`. This is safe,
transparent and fully reversible. The app will guide you through the setup process.

---

That’s it! Set your preference, and never worry about your light/dark mode again.
