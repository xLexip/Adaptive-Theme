**Adaptive Theme** automatically switches between Light and Dark mode using the physical ambient
light sensor – not a fixed schedule.

It adapts to your actual environment to optimize readability, eye
comfort, and battery life.

**Features & Highlights**

- **Smart Detection:** Real-time theme switching based on ambient light levels (lux).
- **Custom Thresholds:** You choose exactly at which brightness level the theme should flip.
- **Battery Friendly:** Event-driven architecture. The app only checks the sensor for a split second
  when the screen turns on.
- **Modern UI:** Native experience built with Jetpack Compose and Material You / Material 3.

**Setup Methods**

Android restricts apps from changing system themes by default. To unlock this feature, a one-time
setup is required to grant the `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission.

The app provides a step-by-step setup wizard.
You can choose the method that fits best:

- **Web Tool (Recommended):** Use the browser-based setup on a computer or secondary device. No ADB
  installation required (WebADB).
- **Shizuku:** Grant permission directly if you use the Shizuku manager.
- **Root:** Grant permission with a single tap if your device is rooted.
- **Manual ADB:** For power users who prefer the command line.

**How it works**

To ensure a seamless experience without battery drain or usage interruptions, Adaptive Theme follows
strict rules:

- It only checks the sensor immediately after the screen is turned on.
- It verifies the sensor isn't covered (e.g., by your hand or pocket) before switching the theme
  instantly.

Adaptive Theme is completely free and developed as an open-source project in my free time.
